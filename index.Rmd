## Introduction

* The shiny app can be used to extract detailed crime profile of a postcode.

* All one has to do is click on a postcode and select required options 

* It can cater to many different usecases like 
    + Crime Profiler
    + Insurance
    + Urban Planning


--- 

## Libraries used

* Shiny and ShinyDashboard for making the app

* Leaflet to use OpenStreet Map

* ggmap to overlay a shape file of postalcode boundaries

* plotly to display the line chart

---

## Demo Time

* Map overlayed with postalcode boundaries

```{r echo=FALSE,error=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
suppressMessages(library(leaflet))
suppressMessages(library(maptools))

chicago = readShapeSpatial("chicago.shp")
l <-    leaflet() %>% setView(lng = -87.6298, lat = 41.8781, zoom = 10) %>%
        addTiles() %>%
        addPolygons(data=chicago,weight=1,color="blue")

l
```

## The path ahead

* Using tools such as R for data science can be very helpful in many avenues still unearthed

* Thanks for such a great specialization
